Convolutional Neural Networks to build a plants illness clasificator using: https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset <br>
Dataset contains 50,000 photos of leaves group in 38 class for different species and diseases. 

We created multiple different networks (such as inception networks and residual networks) achieve 0.9768 accuracy in predicting class. <br>
